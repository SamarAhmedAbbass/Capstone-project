# Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone project
This project is "Emotion detection" Algorithm that intended to aid blind people, where the code will be fed by input images and the code will read, analyze, process, extract features from image featured then classify the face in the image to one of the seven classes: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise or Neutral. It was inspired by a facial expression recognition competition on kaggle using “fer2103” dataset.
